## 2. Will the formatting in my Google Doc be preserved?

## 3. What happens to images in the document?

## 4. Can I publish a document as a draft?

Yes. Docs to WP Pro allows you to choose between different publishing modes:  
- Publish as Draft  
- Publish Immediately  
- Update Existing Post  

These options are available before each push operation.

## 5. Can I update an existing WordPress post using this extension?

Yes. You can update a previously published post by selecting the “Update Existing Post” option before pushing. This ensures that your WordPress content stays in sync with the latest version of your Google Doc.

---

## 6. Can I assign categories or tags while pushing content?

At present, categories and tags should be assigned within the WordPress editor after content has been published. Integration of taxonomy selection during the push process is under consideration for future updates.

---

## 7. What if I make changes to my Google Doc after publishing?

You can re-push the updated document at any time. If the document was linked to an existing WordPress post, it will be updated with the latest content—eliminating the need for manual edits.

---

## 8. Is a plugin installation required on the WordPress site?

No. The extension communicates with WordPress using its built-in REST API and application passwords. No additional plugin installation is necessary on the WordPress site.

---

## 9. Will publishing content using Docs to WordPress Pro change the design or structure of my website?

No, publishing content through Docs to WordPress Pro will not modify your website’s design or structural layout. The extension generates clean, semantic HTML that is styled by your existing WordPress theme.

While structural elements such as headings, lists, images, and links are preserved during the publishing process, the final appearance depends entirely on how your theme applies styles to these elements. As a result, some minor differences in spacing or visual layout may appear based on your theme's configuration.

---

## 10. Can I push content to multiple WordPress sites?

Yes. You can configure and save multiple WordPress site connections within the extension. Before pushing content, simply select the site where you want the document to be published.
