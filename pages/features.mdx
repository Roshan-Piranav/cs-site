# Features

Docs to WordPress Pro is designed to streamline the documentation publishing process by offering robust, enterprise-ready features that integrate seamlessly with WordPress. Below is an overview of the key capabilities:

### ● Seamless WordPress Integration

Publish documentation directly from Google Docs to WordPress with a single click. It preserves formatting and layout to ensure consistent structure on your site.

### ● Real-Time Synchronization

Any updates made in Google Docs are instantly reflected on the connected WordPress post. This eliminates the need for repetitive exports or manual syncing.

### ● Multi-Site Management

Manage multiple WordPress websites from one central interface. Ideal for teams, agencies, or multi-brand operations needing fast content deployment.

### ● Structured Content Preservation

Docs TM retains all content formatting such as headings, lists, images, and code blocks. This ensures the visual and semantic structure is faithfully maintained in WordPress.

### ● Secure Authentication

The integration uses WordPress application passwords, removing the need for admin credentials. All communication is securely handled through the REST API.

### ● Customizable Publishing Defaults

Set default tags, categories, post status, and target site before publishing. This saves time and ensures consistency across multiple documentation pages.

### ● Optimized for Performance and SEO

Content is exported as clean, minimal HTML for faster load times. This enhances Core Web Vitals and improves search engine visibility and structure.

### ● User-Friendly Interface

Docs TM features an intuitive sidebar inside Google Docs with simple controls. Both technical and non-technical users can preview and publish content with ease.
