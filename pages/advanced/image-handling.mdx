# Image Handling

**Docs to WordPress Pro**,simplifies how images are managed when moving content from Google Docs to WordPress. This guide explains how images are handled, preserved, and displayed after publishing.

## How Image Handling Works

When you insert images directly into a Google Doc and push the content using Docs to WP Pro:

- Images are automatically extracted from the document  
- They are uploaded to the WordPress Media Library  
- Each image is placed in the same position as in the original document  
- Basic formatting such as size, alignment, and captions are preserved when possible

---

## Supported Image Formats

Docs to WP Pro supports the most common image types:

- JPEG / JPG  
- PNG  
- GIF (static images only)  
- WebP (depending on WordPress and browser support)

---

## Best Practices

To ensure your images appear correctly and load efficiently:

- Use high-quality images that are optimized for the web (preferably under 1MB)  
- Embed images directly in your Google Doc instead of linking them from elsewhere  
- Add meaningful alt text or captions to support accessibility and SEO  
- Use descriptive filenames such as `project-diagram.png` instead of `image1.png`

## Important Notes

While image publishing is handled smoothly, here are a few things to keep in mind:

- Images added through Google Drive links may not appear correctly  
- Very large or complex image layouts may be simplified during publishing  
- Advanced layout styles (like floating images with text wrap) may be adjusted for compatibility with WordPress themes

## Troubleshooting Tips

If images donâ€™t appear as expected after publishing, here are a few things to check:

- **Image not visible on the page**: Make sure the image was inserted directly into the Google Doc (not linked from Google Drive or other external sources).
  
- **Wrong alignment or size**: Adjust the image placement in Google Docs using built-in alignment tools. Docs to WP Pro reflects basic layout, but complex formatting may not fully carry over.
  
- **Slow loading or broken image**: Ensure the original image is not too large and has a valid file format (JPG, PNG, etc.). Compress large images before inserting them.
  
- **Missing alt text**: Add captions or descriptions in the doc that can be recognized and converted as alt text in WordPress.

For persistent issues, review your WordPress media settings or consult your theme's styling behavior, as it may affect how images are displayed.
