### 1. Start with a Keyword-Rich Title

Use a clear and concise title in your Google Doc that includes your primary keyword.  
Docs to WP Pro retains this title as the post title in WordPress—an important factor for search engine indexing.

### 2. Use Headings Properly

Structure your document using the correct hierarchy:
- `Heading 1` (`<h1>`) for the main title (use only once)
- `Heading 2` and `Heading 3` for sections and sub-sections

Proper heading usage improves readability and allows search engines to better understand your content structure.

### 3. Add Meta Descriptions

If your setup supports custom fields, include a meta description within the document summary or as a dedicated block.  
Keep it under **160 characters** and include the focus keyword to improve search snippet previews.

### 4. Use Descriptive Links and Anchor Text

When adding hyperlinks:
- Use meaningful text instead of generic phrases like “click here”
- Link internally to relevant WordPress pages and externally to trusted sources

These links are preserved by Docs to WP Pro and contribute to both SEO and user navigation.

- Use relevant images with descriptive file names (e.g., `seo-checklist.png`)
- Add alt text and captions in Google Docs—Docs to WP Pro can retain these
- Compress images to reduce loading times without compromising quality

After the content is pushed to WordPress, assign appropriate tags and categories.  
This improves content organization and topical authority.

### 8. Optimize Permalink Structure

Ensure the URL slug generated in WordPress accurately reflects the content topic.  
You can edit the permalink within WordPress if needed for better clarity and SEO.
