# Connecting Docs to WordPress

5. Copy the password shown and **paste it into the Docs to WordPress Pro sidebar**:  
   Go to **Settings → Site Configuration → Application Password**.

> You will not see this password again, so store it safely.

Once entered, Docs will be connected and ready to publish directly to WordPress.

> [Go to Adding Sites →](./adding-Sites.mdx) Learn how to properly configure and manage WordPress site connections inside the extension.
